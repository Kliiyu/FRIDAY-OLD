# FRIDAY
# Getting started

Welcome to the FRIDAY project! For more details and a step by step install guide, visit our [documentation](https://kliiyu.github.io/FRIDAY/).

## Introduction to FRIDAY

FRIDAY is an ambitious project: a personal AI assistant inspired by the intelligent systems in the Iron Man series. Designed to run functions, engage in casual conversation, and remember key information, FRIDAY is built to bring a highly interactive AI experience to life.

FRIDAY isn't just another assistant; it's my own experiment with technology, combining tools and APIs in innovative ways to push the boundaries of what a personal AI can achieve. This side project lets me explore, test, and integrate technologies that bring FRIDAY closer to the capabilities of Iron Man's JARVIS and FRIDAY assistants.
