# FRIDAY: Your Personal AI Assistant

---

## Introduction to FRIDAY

**FRIDAY** is an ambitious project: a personal AI assistant inspired by the intelligent systems in the *Iron Man* series. Designed to run functions, engage in casual conversation, and remember key information, FRIDAY is built to bring a highly interactive AI experience to life. 

FRIDAY isn't just another assistant; it’s my own experiment with technology, combining tools and APIs in innovative ways to push the boundaries of what a personal AI can achieve. This side project lets me explore, test, and integrate technologies that bring FRIDAY closer to the capabilities of Iron Man’s JARVIS and FRIDAY assistants.

## What FRIDAY Can Do

FRIDAY has been designed to emulate the following core capabilities:

- **Function Execution**: FRIDAY can run specific tasks or functions, making it useful for handling various automations and command executions.
  
- **Casual Conversations**: Beyond functionality, FRIDAY can engage in casual conversations, making interactions feel natural and enjoyable.
  
- **Memory Management**: The AI has a memory feature, enabling it to remember important context, preferences, and recurring information. This allows FRIDAY to provide more personalized and contextually aware responses over time.

## Technology and Design

FRIDAY is a learning and testing playground for various technologies, APIs, and development techniques. Built with a collection of **free-to-use APIs** and frameworks, FRIDAY’s development has remained low-cost, making it accessible and feasible as a side project. All project planning and feature tracking is organized in **Trello** to ensure each development milestone is met effectively.

### Key Technologies

FRIDAY also integrates **Ollama** to expand its AI capabilities, adding a layer of powerful natural language understanding and conversational ability that brings it closer to emulating real-time, dynamic interaction.
This allows FRIDAY run completely local. (Except for APIs)

## Project Vision

The vision for FRIDAY is expansive. Inspired by the impressive AI systems in the *Iron Man* series, I aim to build an assistant that feels as intelligent, responsive, and versatile as those fictional counterparts. With continuous learning and advancements in AI, I hope to bring FRIDAY closer to this goal, making it capable of assisting users in ways beyond current, conventional AI assistants.
